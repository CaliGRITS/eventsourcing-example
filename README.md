# Event Sourcing Microservices Example

This repository is an example of a microservices style application using the event sourcing pattern, with Kafka as both the event publishing mechanism and the events source of truth.  It contains a mixture of C# (.Net Core 2.0), Ruby and TypeScript.

2. Install the [Zookeeper](https://github.com/kontena/kontena-stacks/tree/master/zookeeper) and [Kafka](https://github.com/kontena/kontena-stacks/tree/master/kafka) stacks on your Kontena Platform.
3. Install the eventsourcing-tutorial stack: `$ kontena stack install kontena/eventsourcing-example`
4. Execute the `init-topics.sh` script
